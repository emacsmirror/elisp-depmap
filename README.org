#+TITLE: package-map.el

Generate a GraphViz-compatible DOT file representation of all the top-level definitions in a project, and represent the connections between them.

The idea is that your code should be structured in an untangled way (i.e. split into standalone libraries contained within specific files), and this helps represent that.


* Installation

  #+begin_src 
(use-package package-map.el)

  #+end_src

* Usage

Just call =package-map-makedotfile= or =package-map-makesummarytable=.
